# bda-real-estate-2025
This repository contains a full pipeline for a machine learning project focused on predicting residential real estate sale prices. The project was completed as part of the Business Data Analytics course at CBS and includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

# Repository Structure
ML, Real estate.ipynb - Main analysis and modeling notebook
prediction_data.csv - 3 sampled properties used for final prediction
real_estate_data_combined_cleaned.csv - Cleaned dataset used throughout
README.md - Project overview and usage
LICENSE - Licensing information

# Objectives
- Explore and prepare real-world housing data for modeling
- Train and evaluate three regression models:
    a) Linear Regression
    b) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    c) Random Forest Regressor
- Use SelectKBest for feature selection and GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV for tuning
- Predict sale prices on unseen data
